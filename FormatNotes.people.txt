This file describes the format for the files of the type *.people.txt.

These files consist of pipe delimited text columns.  Every line should 
have 9 columns.  Each line codes information for a distinct separate 
person.  Some sample lines are shown below:

Hickstein|Unknown||M|1130|0|0|?/?/?|?/?/?
Kaney|Adam Michael||M|38|33|36|01/07/1992|?/?/?
Kaney|Brian Todd||M|33|1|32|10/30/1959|?/?/?
Kaney|Edwin Frederick||M|2|6|7|09/13/1882|06/22/1950
Kaney|Henry|Jr|M|6|8|9|12/25/1848|10/11/1888
Kaney|Henry|Sr|M|8|0|0|03/09/1817|08/21/1899
Klemme|Anna Marie Elisabeth||F|1060|1065|1066|12/?/1755|03/07/1811

The columns are explained below. Column 1 is the last name.  Column 2 
is the first name and any middle name or names, if known.  Either of these 
columns could contain just '?' if unknown.  Column 3 is any name suffix 
added to the last name, such as 'Jr' or 'II'.  This column is empty in 
most cases.

The full name for the person will be printed as column 2, a space, column 
1, a possible space and column 3.  The second possible space only occurs 
if the column 3 string is not empty.

So 'Kaney|Brian Todd||' will print as 'Brian Todd Kaney'.  
And 'Kaney|Henry|Sr|' will print as 'Henry Kaney Sr'.

Column 4 will contain either 'M' for male, 'F' for female or '?'.

Column 5 will be the integer index for the individual represented by the 
line in question.  These should be unique to each line of the file.  The 
full names can be identical for different people, but this integer index 
will distinguish them.

Columns 6 and 7 will be the integer indexes for the father and the mother 
(in that order) for the person represented by that file line.  These 
integers must match the person index (column 5) for some other line in 
the file.  Or either could be a '-1' indicating that parent is not in 
the file 

Columns 8 and 9 are the birth date and death date (in that order) for the 
person represented by that file line.  These dates must be in the form 
MM/DD/YYYY.  Although any of the three number fields can also contain a 
single '?' if that field is unknown.  So if the date is completely 
unknown you'll have ?/?/?.
