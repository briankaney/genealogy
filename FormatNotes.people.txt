This file describes the format for the files of the type *.people.txt.

These files consist of pipe delimited text columns.  Every line should 
have 9 columns.  Some sample lines are shown below:

Hickstein|Unknown||M|1130|0|0|?/?/?|?/?/?
Kaney|Adam Michael||M|38|33|36|01/07/1992|?/?/?
Kaney|Brian Todd||M|33|1|32|10/30/1959|?/?/?
Kaney|Edwin Frederick||M|2|6|7|09/13/1882|06/22/1950
Klemme|Anna Marie Elisabeth||F|1060|1065|1066|12/?/1755|03/07/1811

The columns are explained below. Column 1 is the last name.  Column 2 
is the first name and any middle name or names, if known.  Either if these 
columns could contain just '?' if unknown.  Column 3 is any name suffix 
added to the last name, such as 'Jr' or 'II'.  The full name for the person 
will be printed as column 2, a space, column 1, a possible space and column 3. 
The second possible space only occurs if the column 3 string is not empty.

So Kaney|Brian Todd|| will print as 'Brian Todd Kaney'.
