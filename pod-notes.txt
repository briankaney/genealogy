These 'pod' files contain people with no biological connection to anyone 
in the main Kaney tree.  They are linked by marriage only.  At this point 
marriages have not been intgrated into my code.

The pods are not ALL the people with no biological connection.  Most of 
these are 'singles', i.e. a lone individual with no biological connection 
to anyone other person.  These are left in the main Kaney tree and there 
is a script to find these and a list exists elsewhere.

The pods are special in that it is someone who married into the Kaney 
family tree, but did not have any offspring with anyone in the Kaney 
tree but did have kids with other people also unrelated to the Kaney's. 
There are only two cases so far and these make it clear how this works.

1.)  The Zaino pod is linked to the Kaney's by marriage with Paul Kaney by:

Stenglin|Judith May||F|39|1451|1452|20|01/16/1933|259|11/26/2011

2.)  The Gitz pod is linked to the Kaney's by marriage with Edwin M Zumdahl by:
